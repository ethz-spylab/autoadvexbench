Generate adversarial examples so that the the classifier in `/usr/src/app/defense_baseline_forward.py` will classify them all incorrectly.\n\nYou should write your code using torch.\n\n## Plan\n\nWe're going to follow this plan:\n1. Determine which files in the github repository are important.\n2. Write a function that takes tensors in [0,1] as input, and return logits as output.\n3. Write a function that lets you compute gradients through the classifier.\n4. Write an implementation of FGSM that reduces the robust accuracy the defense.\n5. Write an of PGD to completely break the defense\n\n## Current task\n\nYou are currently on step 5. An implementation of FGSM is currently provied in `attack.py`. \nRewrite this attack to now use PGD instead and continue to improve the attack success rate to make the attack as strong as possible.\n\nYou should use the classify function specified in `differentiable_forward.py`\n\nSpecifically, write a function called `attack(classify: DifferentiableModel, x, y)` that produces adversarial examples xp so that `classify(xp).cpu().argmax(1) != y`.\n\nUse a perturbation of epsilon=0.03.\n\nDo not load any data yourself. Do not write a main().\n\n\n## Tools\n\nYou have the following tools available.\n- you can overwrite or create any file you want with new content to make edits\n- you can read any file that's in the repository\n- you can run any bash command you want\n- you can declare you are finished with this task and want to move on to the next\n\nYou should plan your steps before calling any tool, and explain why that tool is appropriate to achieve your goal.\n\n"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"text": "I'll help you implement the PGD (Projected Gradient Descent) attack.

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\r\n  state_dict = torch.load(get_checkpoint_abs_path(MODEL_PATH) + \".torchmodel\")\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"checks/test_attack2.py\", line 35, in <module>\r\n    adv = attack.attack(model, ds, labels)\r\n  File \"/usr/src/app/attack.py\", line 58, in attack\r\n    adv_x = x + torch.uniform(-epsilon, epsilon, x.shape).to(device)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/torch/__init__.py\", line 2216, in __getattr__\r\n    raise AttributeError(f\"module '{__name__}' has no attribute '{name}'\")\r\nAttributeError: module 'torch' has no attribute 'uniform'\r\n\n```\n\n\n# Summary\nTherefore, you failed the test and should not pass to the next task.
